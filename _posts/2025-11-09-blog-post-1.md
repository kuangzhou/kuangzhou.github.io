## Special Session Title

Data- and AI-Driven Approaches for Complex Systems and Complex Networks  

## Description

In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing data- and AI-driven methods for modeling, analyzing, and optimizing complex systems and networks. These approaches are capable of capturing complex dependencies, diverse relationships, and dynamic changes across a wide range of systems, from cyber-physical infrastructures and intelligent transportation networks to social and biological networks, among others.

Data- and AI-driven techniques have shown great potential in tasks such as identifying critical nodes in complex networks, analyzing network robustness, vulnerability and resilience, and extracting latent structural patterns in graph data. These methods allow for more intelligent system representation, enabling adaptive decision-making and predictive modeling in complex environments. They contribute to advancing our understanding of systemic behaviors and improving control and management strategies for real-world complex systems and graphs.

This special session aims to unite researchers and practitioners to explore cutting-edge data- and AI-driven methods for modeling complex systems, complex networks and graphs, advancing the synergy among systems science, artificial intelligence, and cybernetics.
