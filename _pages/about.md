# Research Interests

- Statistical machine learning
- Uncertain data analysis and fusion
- Causal-inspired machine learning
- Graph data analysis
- Reliability analysis

# What are we doing

In simple terms, our goal is try to address the following issues in machine learning: 

- Know what the machine knows, and **understand why it knows**

- **Know what the machine does not know**, and **be aware of why it  does not know**

知明者，溯其光；知晦者，探其疆。

# Openings

- I have openings for students who want to conduct research related to statistical machine learning, causal machine learning and complex networks,  please feel free to contact me if you are interested.
